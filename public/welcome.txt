This application is intended to help teach users how to use ASL (American Sign Language) through image cards.
ASL is a natural sign based language that is popular amongst the deaf community. To get started, click the 'Translate' 
tab and enter desired statement to be translated into ASL. You will be shown images for each word typed. If a word isn't 
found in our database, it will be written in letters. Want to contribute to our dictionary with a new word? Try the 
'Add Word' tab to be sent to our word form which takes a word and an image url.
